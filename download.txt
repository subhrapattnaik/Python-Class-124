API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.

Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated

Notes:

All APIs use an HTTP method. Let’s see what they are:

The GET Method -
GET is used to request data from a specified resource. When you access
a website’s page, your browser makes a get request to your API and
your API is returning the front-end that is displayed in the browser.

All the APIs that you create in Flask,by default, use GET Request. If you
start your hello_world server and go to localhost:5000, you can see in your
terminal that the browser made a GET request on the server/API.



The POST Method -
POST is used to send data to the server to create/update a resource.
A user wants to sign up from the signup page? A user wants to change
their password? That would be a post request.


The PUT Method -
PUT is used to send data to a server to create / update a resource.
The basic difference between PUT and POST is that a POST request is
when you can create multiple copies of the same resource.

A PUT request, on the other hand means that you want to create only
one copy of the resource, i.e. Signing Up a unique user.


The DELETE Method -
DELETE is used to delete a resource.The default method used by flask is GET.
