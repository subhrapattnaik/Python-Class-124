Notes:

All APIs use an HTTP method. Let’s see what they are:

The GET Method -
GET is used to request data from a specified resource. When you access
a website’s page, your browser makes a get request to your API and
your API is returning the front-end that is displayed in the browser.

All the APIs that you create in Flask,by default, use GET Request. If you
start your hello_world server and go to localhost:5000, you can see in your
terminal that the browser made a GET request on the server/API.



The POST Method -
POST is used to send data to the server to create/update a resource.
A user wants to sign up from the signup page? A user wants to change
their password? That would be a post request.


The PUT Method -
PUT is used to send data to a server to create / update a resource.
The basic difference between PUT and POST is that a POST request is
when you can create multiple copies of the same resource.

A PUT request, on the other hand means that you want to create only
one copy of the resource, i.e. Signing Up a unique user.


The DELETE Method -
DELETE is used to delete a resource.The default method used by flask is GET.
